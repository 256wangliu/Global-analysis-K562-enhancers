# Global Analysis of 500 enhancer in K562 cells with Mosaic-seq

## Overview
This repository described our scripts and piplines for using Mosaic-seq to functionally evaluate enhancers in K562 cells. Through optimization of key parameters of Mosaic-seq, we demonstrate that both primary and secondary target genes can be identified in the assay. Our investigation of > 500 enhancers in K562 cells reveals an enhancer-centric, interwoven regulatory network that converges to reguate the same sub-modules.
